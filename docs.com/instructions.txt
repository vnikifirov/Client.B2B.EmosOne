Emos1 setup procedure

1. Databases: DemoESR.bacpac & Emos1.bacpac
- Emos1 is databases of all Emos1 clients (with each client's database connection string)
- DemoESR is Demo client database, containing all client data: staff, volunteers, equipment, ...

2. Existing EMOS1 Project template source code: emos2.0-develop.zip
- Emos1 application is two layer application: MVC + API
- MVC must be set under demo sub-domain: for instance http://demo.emos2.local
- MVC must point to API: for example  <add key="apiURL" value="http://api.emos2.local/" />
- API must have set connectionStrings: Emos1Context and ESRContext (depends how you setup databases)

3. Front-end side is in development.
- Pages developed until now are at http://nikatec.com/emos2
- NikaTec will provide html + css for each page

4. Could you provide time estimate you will need for developing a page: http://nikatec.com/emos2/event/events.html
- Events objects are located in Event table in DemoESR database
- Database schema will never be changed by candidates. It will be handled by NikaTec
- Candidates are expected to develop all needed entities based on project template. For instance:
- MVC: Events controller, view and models
- API: Events controller and models
- Business login: base service (CRUD) and custom service if needed  (repository is generic)
- Project template use IoC (Autofac), DI and generic repository pattern
